### gRPC-with-Go
If you're building APIs for your microservices or mobile applications, you definitely want to try gRPC. It is super-fast, strongly-typed, and you no longer need to write a lot of boilerplate codes for services communication. Thanks to awesome HTTP/2 and Protocol Buffer! 

#### In this repo we' ll examine the following gRPC concepts:
- What gRPC is, how it works, why we should use it, and where it is suitable to
- The amazing HTTP/2 protocol that gRPC is built on
- Compare gRPC with REST
- Write and serialise protocol-buffer messages using Go
- Define gRPC services with protocol-buffer and generate Go
- Implement 4 types of gRPC using Go: unary, server-streaming, client-streaming, bidirectional streaming
- Handle context deadline, gRPC errors and status codes
- Write production-grade application with interfaces and unit tests for gRPC services
- Use gRPC interceptors to authenticate & authorise users with JWT
- Secure gRPC connection with sever-side & mutual SSL/TLS
- Enable gRPC reflections for service discovery
- Load balancing gRPC service
- Use gRPC gateway to generate RESTful service and swagger API
